# CiviCRM Entity for Drupal 10

## Installing 4.0.0-alpha7 or later.

This module is installable with normal Drupal composer install steps, `composer require drupal/civicrm_entity`.
    
**Note:**

You should ensure that your `composer.json` file has versioned requirements for both `civicrm/civicrm-core` and `civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8`.

For example:

``` json
       "civicrm/civicrm-core": "^5.63",
       "civicrm/civicrm-packages": "^5.63",
       "civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8": "^5.63",
```
## CiviCRM Entity Leaflet upgrade to Drupal 10

In the 4.0.x version the civicrm_entity_leaflet module has been removed from the main module repo and put into its own module project http://drupal.org/project/civicrm_entity_leaflet

If upgrading from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10, simply include that module:
`composer require drupal/civicrm_entity_leaflet`

## Version support

8.x-3.x for Drupal 9 Known to work with CiviCRM 5.51+
4.0.x for Drupal 10 Requires CiviCRM 5.60+

We do our best to support as many versions of CiviCRM Core as is feasible. 

CiviCRM Entity is primarily tested and developed against and for ESR versions. Updates due to CiviCRM Core happen as bugs or changes are reported, or are contributed. It is rare that a more recent version of CiviCRM has a problem, but for best success use the ESR.

5.63 recommended at the time of this writing, but no known issues for later versions.

## Issues

For bug reports, support requests, or feature requests please create an issue in the Drupal.org issue queue https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/civicrm_entity


## Contribution

Primary development happens in the github repo: https://github.com/eileenmcnaughton/civicrm_entity

Please make PRs against the 4.0.x branch first. Changes will be merged there, and then backported to the 8.x-3.x branch.

We do plan on shifting primary development to the drupal.org Gitlab infrastructure in time.
